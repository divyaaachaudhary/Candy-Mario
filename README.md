# Candy-Mario
This is a work-in-progress 2D platformer game developed in Unity, inspired by the classic Mario series. The core gameplay involves a player-controlled character navigating through levels and collecting coins. I built the entire game from scratch using C#, handling everything from player movement and collision detection to coin collection mechanics. I also designed the basic level layout and integrated visual and audio feedback for player actions. This project showcases my skills in game logic implementation, Unity scripting, and iterative development.
